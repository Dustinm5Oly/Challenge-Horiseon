# Challenge-Horiseon

## Updating Horiseon Website to HTML5 structure

- I was motivated to make changes to this project to make it more accessible and change the format from HTML4 to HTML5.
- The reason for the project is to make it more accessible to other developers.
- While altering this website, I ran into issues condesing the css selectors and changing the elements of the html.
- I learned how to combine css selector elements and what to change from html4 to html5 elements
